      the Apple Application may only be accessed and used on a device owned or controlled by you and using the Apple iPhone OS;
      you acknowledge and agree that:
      • Apple has no obligation at all to provide any support or maintenance services in relation to the Apple Application. If you have any maintenance or support questions in relation to the Apple Apps, please contact us, not Apple, using the contacting us details at the end of these terms;

      • you are not listed on any US Government list of prohibited or restricted parties; and
      if the Apple Application that you have purchased does not conform to any warranty applying to it, you may notify Apple, which will then refund the purchase price of the Apple Application to you. Subject to that, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple does not give or enter into any warranty, condition or other term in relation to the Apple Application and will not be liable to you for any claims, losses, costs or expenses of whatever nature in relation to the Apple Application or as a result of you or anyone else using the Apple Apps or relying on any of its content.

      We do not accept any liability (regardless of how it might arise) for any claim or loss arising from:
      any advice given;
      any investment or other decision made; or
      any transaction made or effected;
      in reliance on, or on the basis of, any FTSE Media nor for any such liability arising from any other use of, or reliance on, the FTSE Media.
      We do not enter into any terms or make any representations as to the accuracy, completeness, currency, correctness, reliability, integrity, quality, fitness for purpose or originality of any content of the FTSE Media and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all implied warranties, conditions or other terms of any kind are hereby excluded. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we accept no liability for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of you or anyone else using the FTSE Media or relying on any of its content.
      We cannot and do not guarantee that any content of the FTSE Media will be free from viruses and/or other code that may have contaminating or destructive elements. It is your responsibility to implement appropriate IT security safeguards (including anti-virus and other security checks) to satisfy your particular requirements as to the safety and reliability of content.

      Use of your personal information submitted to us (whether via our website or otherwise) is governed by our privacy policy .
      External links
      Our website may, from time to time, include links to external sites. We have included links to these sites to provide you with access to information and services that you may find useful or interesting. We are not responsible for the content of these sites or for anything provided by them and do not guarantee that they will be continuously available. The fact that we include links to such external sites does not imply any endorsement of, or association with, their operators.
      General
      Nothing in these terms shall limit or exclude our liability to you for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or for fraudulent misrepresentation or any other liability that may not, under English law, be limited or excluded. Subject to this, if you are a consumer and not a business user, in no event shall we be liable to you for any business losses and any liability we do have for losses you suffer is strictly limited to losses that were reasonably foreseeable, and if you are a business user, in no event shall we be liable to you for any indirect or consequential losses, or for any loss of profit, revenue, contracts, data, goodwill or other similar losses.
      These terms shall be governed by English law, and you agree that any dispute between us regarding them or the FTSE Media will only be dealt with by the English courts, provided that, if you are a consumer and not a business user and live in a part of the United Kingdom other than England, the applicable law of that part of the United Kingdom will govern and any dispute will only be dealt with by the courts there. Nothing shall prevent us from bringing proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights before any competent court.</p>
